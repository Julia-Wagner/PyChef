### **Flowchart**

To visualize the necessary steps to create my cookbook, I created a flowchart using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/11478dde-0293-49ef-95b3-c7f9f842cd13/edit?viewport_loc=-61%2C227%2C2994%2C1412%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_b097e12e-4e66-440b-bf17-5d18fb3dd66d).

On the welcome screen ASCII Art with a book and the name of the application is displayed. Underneath the welcome message, the user can decide whether they want to log in or create a new account.

(Note: my screen recorder for some reason changes the color of the ASCII Art, it is all white in the application.)

- The [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/p3-template) was used for this project to have a fake terminal in the browser.
- I used the walkthrough project from Code Institute as a reference on how to connect my project to Google Sheets.
- The method to clear the console is from [DelftStack](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-clear-console/).
